## Things to consider:

- ignore editorials
- desirable to identify experimental studies and distinguish from e.g. corpus 
    - possible automatice approximation: Look for terms like "participants / speakers / listeners" etc.
    - maybe check keywords
- manual checks should probably be coded by both of us and then discussed if diverging


## Topics to cover:

### Statistical errors:
- stat check results (http://statcheck.io/)
- done already, we potentially need to manually check the errors

### Publication bias
- check for significant results (first hypothesis mentioned) (see Scheel et al. 2020: https://psyarxiv.com/p6e9c/)
    - automatization: "test* the hypothes*"(Fanelli, 2010), "predicted that" (Scheel et al. 2020)
        - "For the majority of Registered Reports (49), we identified one hypothesis-introduction phrase; the remaining ones used two (16 RRs), three (4 RRs), or four (1 RR) different phrases or had no identifiable hypothesis introduction (1 RR). In this total set of 97 hypothesis introductions, we found 64 unique phrases showing substantial linguistic variation (see Tables 2 and 3). [...] the five most frequent word stems were ‘hypothes∗’ (34 occurrences), ‘replicat∗’ (24), ‘test∗’ (20), ‘examine∗’ (8), and ‘predict∗’" (Scheel et al. 2020: 7)
    
    - for that we need to identify hypotheses (manually)
    - check p-values?

### Sample size
- manually

### Better theories
- check for magnitude of acoustic results
    - for that we need to identify acoustic studies
      - maybe terms like acoustic anal* 
    - focus on f0 (Hz), duration (ms) and itensity (dB)
        - also need to check JND literature to set thresholds (ask Dan)
    - if effect doesn't pass JND, manually check whether the paper discusses this 

### Replications
- follow Make et al: Check for repli* and then manually check the content.

### Preregistration
- check for preregist*

### Open Materials
- Check hyperlinks
- What is actually available (raw, datatable, materials, scripts?)

### Exploratory analyses?
- explorat*
- how many papers mention hypothesi*
