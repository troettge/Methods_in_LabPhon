## Things to consider:

- ignore editorials
- desirable to identify experimental studies and distinguish from e.g. corpus 
    - possible automatice approximation: Look for terms like "participants / speakers / listeners" etc.
    - maybe check keywords


## Topics to cover:

### Statistical errors:
- stat check results (http://statcheck.io/)
- done already, we potentially need to manually check the errors

### Publication bias
- check for significant results (first hypothesis mentioned) (see Scheel et al. 2020: https://psyarxiv.com/p6e9c/)
    - automaitization: test* the hypothes*’(Fanelli, 2010).
    - for that we need to identify hypotheses (manually)
    - check p-values?

### Sample size
- manually

### Better theories
- check for magnitude of acoustic results
    - for that we need to identify acoustic studies
      - maybe terms like acoustic anal* 
    - focus on f0 (Hz), duration (ms) and itensity (dB)
        - also need to check JND literature to set thresholds (ask Dan)
    - if effect doesn't pass JND, manually check whether the paper discusses this 

### Replications
- follow Make et al: Check for repli* and then manually check the content.

### Preregistration
- check for preregist*

### Open Materials
- Check hyperlinks
- What is actually available (raw, datatable, materials, scripts?)

### Exploratory analyses?
- explorat*
- how many papers mention hypothesi*
